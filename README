ruby_core_ri

Installs the ri for Ruby's core docs for your current version, even if they didn't come with your distro.

This utility is for those of us whose ruby distros are lacking in core RI.  For example.

$ ri File
Nothing known about File

$

now becomes

$ ri File

This is quite helpful for those of us who want to use ri for core classes.  For me, at least, ri is quite useless without it.

== Installation (takes a little while) ==

$ gem install ruby_core_ri --source=http://gemcutter.org
$ install_ruby_core_ri # download core's source, ri's it locally for you


== Known issues ==
You may need to uninstall the mislav-hanna gem first, if installed.
