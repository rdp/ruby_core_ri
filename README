ruby_core_ri gem

This utility is for those of us whose ruby distros are lacking in core RI (ex: mingw).  For example.

$ ri File
Nothing known about File

Becomes

The gem downloads the source for your current Ruby version, then does a gem --ri against it, thus installing the ri for Ruby's core docs.

This is quite helpful for those of us who want to use ri for core classes.

== Installation (takes a little while) ==

$ gem install ruby_core_ri
$ ruby_core_ri # run this command--it download your distro's sources, ri's them locally

== Known issues ==
You may need to uninstall the mislav-hanna gem first, if installed.
