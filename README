ruby_core_ri gem

This utility is for those whose ruby distros are lacking the core RI (ex: mingw).  For example, if you get this:

$ ri File
Nothing known about File


After installing this gem, you will get the following:

$ ri File

The gem downloads the source for your current Ruby version, then does a gem --ri 
against your version, thus installing the ri for Ruby's core docs locally.

This is quite helpful for those of us who want to use ri for core classes.

== Installation (takes a little while) ==

* For all versions:

$ gem install ruby_core_ri
$ ruby_core_ri # download your distro's sources, ri's them locally

* Note: for 1.9 users you have to install rdoc > 2.4.3 for it to work.  To do so (until it is released):

    $ gem install specific_install
    $ gem specific_install -l http://github.com/downloads/rdp/ruby_core_ri/rdoc-2.4.9a.gem

    Also for windows 1.9 users, you may have to manually go into your install and delete the file "test/ruby/test_sprintf.rb"
      ex: C:\Ruby19\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\ruby_core_ri-0.4.0\lib\downloaded_full_source>rm test/ruby/test_sprintf.rb (and then clear your cache--see below)
    
== Trouble Shooting ==

With gems v 1.3.6, it "refuses to regenerate" ri and rdoc (even on failed installs of the same).

So if you do an install and "nothing happens":
$ gem rdoc --no-rdoc --ri ruby_core_ri

$ # note lack of output, above
Then you may have to uninstall the gem, or remove your C:\Ruby19\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\doc\ruby_core_ri-0.4.0 directory before running ruby_core_ri again.

You may also need to uninstall the mislav-hanna gem first, if you have it installed (which is probably rare).
