ruby_core_ri gem

This utility is for those whose ruby distros are lacking the core RI (ex: mingw).  For example, if you get this:

$ ri File
Nothing known about File


After installing this gem, you will get the following:

$ ri File
--------------------------------------------------- Class: File < Object

FTOOLS.RB: EXTRA TOOLS FOR THE FILE CLASS

The gem downloads the source for your current Ruby version, then does a gem --ri 
against your version, thus installing the ri for Ruby's core docs locally.

This is quite helpful for those of us who want to use ri for core classes.

== Installation (takes a little while) ==

* For all versions:

$ gem install ruby_core_ri
$ ruby_core_ri # download your distro's sources, ri's them locally

* Note: for 1.9 users you have to install rdoc > 2.4.3 for it to work.  To do so (until it is released):

    $ gem install specific_install
    $ gem git_install -l http://github.com/downloads/rdp/rdoc/rdoc-2.5.0.prealpha.gem

== Known issues ==
You may need to uninstall the mislav-hanna gem first, if you have it installed (which is probably pretty rare).
